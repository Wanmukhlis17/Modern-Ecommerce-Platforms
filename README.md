Therefore, this website is an efficient and secure tool that has the capability to improve and enhance the quality of tea leaf sales in a highly effective and safe manner.

## *Introduction*

## *Method*
I developed Kusmi Tea's E-Commerce Website using the **Agile method**, a flexible approach perfectly suited for the ever-evolving world of online tea sales. </br>

• Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. </br>
• It's particularly well-suited for projects like Kusmi Tea's E-Commerce Website, which require ongoing updates, feature additions, and improvements to meet shifting customer preferences and market trends.</br>


My project builds upon an existing theme as the foundation for Kusmi Tea's E-Commerce Website. The theme is **Bosa Decor ShopVersion: 1.0.0 By Bosa Themes**. This theme offers essential design and user interface (UI) elements, product catalog features, responsive design, and more. We've customized and enhanced this theme to align with our specific needs, with a focus on the following aspects:

**1. Customization and Branding**: I customized the theme's appearance to align with Kusmi Tea identity by using the Element tool, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing online presence.

**2. Plugin Integration**: I integrated key plugins like WooCommerce, PDF Invoices & Packing Slips, and Opn Payments to extend the theme's functionality.

**3. Content Management**: My project leverages the strong content management capabilities of WordPress and WooCommerce to efficiently organize and maintain our tea leaves. Here are some key points of content management within our Kusmi Tea ecommerce website:
- Product Listings: Each type of tea in my inventory is treated as a content item within WordPress. This approach enables me to create comprehensive listings for each tea, encompassing details such as tea names, origins, flavor profiles, descriptions, images of the packaging, prices, and more.
- Categories and Varieties: WordPress and WooCommerce allow me to categorize and label tea types based on their flavors, origins, and other pertinent characteristics. This categorization ensures that customers can effortlessly explore and find different tea varieties within my online store.
- Inventory Tracking: I use WooCommerce's inventory management capabilities to monitor the availability of each tea variety. This involves labeling teas as "in stock" or "out of stock," with automatic website updates.
- Content Updates: WordPress facilitates seamless updates to tea descriptions, customer reviews, and other content components. This guarantees that our website delivers current and precise information to our tea-loving customers.
- User-Generated Content: Customers can actively participate in our content by submitting reviews and ratings for the tea leaves they've purchased. WordPress manages the collection and presentation of these user-generated content contributions for our tea products.

## *Visual Overview*



My model will have three parts: 
1. Customer
2. System administrator
3. Shipping company

- The first thing that customers can do on the website is to choose the product as you like and can read the details about that product. When customers like any product, click to order. We have a payment channel and when the customer is finished, can go to check the bill as the address that has been filled in and wait for the product to be delivered home.

The aforementioned format is the same as in this picture

- And in the part of the admin, if you have received the order, you will check how many products are and will send items about the products ordered to be delivered to the shipper or delivery

The second part is the admin part.

- Then when the delivery receives the order, they will check the product number so that the product does not mix or send the wrong place. Must check before sending to customers

The third part will be a transport company

And this is a complete overview of how our business works.
