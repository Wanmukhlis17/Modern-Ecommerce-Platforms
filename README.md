# Modern-Ecommerce-Platforms
Design and Develop Modern Ecommerce Plafform

Project Overview

- Our website is about selling tea leaves. Whether it is black tea or green tea, we will sell it in a jar, 1 jar can brew 40 glasses. And has a workflow or business model. 

My model will have three parts: 
1. Customer
2. System administrator
3. Shipping company

- The first thing that customers can do on the website is to choose the product as you like and can read the details about that product. When customers like any product, click to order. We have a payment channel and when the customer is finished, can go to check the bill as the address that has been filled in and wait for the product to be delivered home.

The aforementioned format is the same as in this picture

- And in the part of the admin, if you have received the order, you will check how many products are and will send items about the products ordered to be delivered to the shipper or delivery

The second part is the admin part.

- Then when the delivery receives the order, they will check the product number so that the product does not mix or send the wrong place. Must check before sending to customers

The third part will be a transport company
